I want to design a tic tac toe game from scratch.

This is my initial thoughts on what i need to accomplish the task.

tic-tac-ui

tic-tac-user-func

I need player 1 and player 2.

I need variables that contain the cuurent user input data and location.

a function that, after every turn that checks to see if the conditions for winning are metm, and, if not, coninues to the next player's turn. If a win, add CSS class that declares winner'

a function that checks if all available moves are made, and no winner, changes heading to say It's a tie.

Bonus:

If I can develop a function to determine if there is any path to victory remaing, and, if not, end the game in a draw. even before all possible moves are made

Finished initial styling prototype. Took about 30 minutes to figure out how to center drop down text, which is longer than I intended. Will start on game logic this evening.
